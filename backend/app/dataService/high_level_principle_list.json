["Contextual Integration: When analyzing sentiment, always integrate visual cues with the verbal content and consider the context in which they occur. Recognize that facial expressions such as seriousness or smiles can have different meanings depending on the spoken content and the situation, and that verbal cues often provide a clearer indication of sentiment when there is a discrepancy with visual cues.", "Recognition of Non-Verbal Nuances: Understand that non-verbal cues like facial expressions can convey complex emotions and may not align directly with the verbal message. A serious expression can coincide with positive sentiments such as earnestness or thoughtfulness, and smiles can be sarcastic or non-genuine.", "Comprehensive Sentiment Analysis: Maintain a holistic approach to sentiment analysis by weighing both verbal and non-verbal cues. Ensure that the interpretation of visual cues like facial expressions and body language is done in conjunction with the tone of voice, the content of speech, and the overall context to arrive at an accurate understanding of the sentiment being expressed."]
